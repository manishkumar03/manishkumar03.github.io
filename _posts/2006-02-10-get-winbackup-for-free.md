Found via [Download Squad](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2006/02/09/get-winbackup-for-free/ "Get WinBackup for free").

WinBackup is offering the version 1.86 of its software for [free](http://www.backupanswers.com/freewinbackup/) whereas the latest version 2.0 costs $49.95. This is a great move. This shows the great confidence they have in their product. They are standing up to the their claim that version 2.0 is actually worth $49.95 over the free product even though version 1.86 itself is pretty good. I wish more companies would do the same.
