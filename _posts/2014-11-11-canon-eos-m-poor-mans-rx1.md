The best way to sum up Canon EOS-M (with 22mm lens) is this - It's a poor man's RX1. Of course it will not match RX1's combo of full-frame sensor with a Zeiss prime but it comes awfully close. And all for a paltry sum of $300 which is what it was selling for as of November 2014.

I have read lots of reviews and examined hundreds of image samples from all kinds of cameras, including the aforementioned RX1. And I can say without any hesitation that this tiny 22mm f/2 lens has ridiculous amounts of resolving power. It's up there with the best of them. In fact, it's being limited by the relatively "low-res" sensor. Here is an example.

This is the complete image: ![Full-Image]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/canon-22mm-f2-full-image.jpg)

And here is a 100% crop: ![Canon 22mm f/2 - 100% Crop]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/canon-22mm-f2-100-pct-crop.jpg)

You can actually read those letters and read them comfortably! Notice how each letter is still distinct even at this tiny size. This would have turned into a blurry mess on a lesser lens. That is some _serious_ resolving power. If this does not make your hair stand up, you are either dead or a medium-format user :-)

I can only imagine what this lens could do on a higher-res sensor. Here is hoping to a 36MP M3.
