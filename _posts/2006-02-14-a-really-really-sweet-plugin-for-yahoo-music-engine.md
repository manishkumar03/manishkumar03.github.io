I am a big fan of Magnatune record label. They allow you to stream/download all of their catalog in 128 kbps DRM free MP3 files. It used to be a pain to browse the site and download though 'cause they didn't give a direct link to the download page. You had to google it and then click on each and every file on that page. Not anymore.

Enter [Web Media Browser](http://www.ymediashare.com/mediabrowser/) plugin for Yahoo Music Engine by YMediaShare. It allows you to browse, queue, and download the Magnatune music directly from YME. No more hunting on Google. You can even queue up all the files you want and it will keep on downloading them in the background. And after downloading, the new music automatically gets added to your media library. Sweet! I was just about to [swear off YME](http://manishbansal.wordpress.com/2005/05/12/why-itunes-worked-and-why-yahoo-music-would-work-too/) for good but this plugin has made me change my mind.

This plugin lets you do some more things also like Browse WebJay playlists directly from YME, download music from lots of different sources, rate them etc. But I am keeping it for the Magnatune thing.
